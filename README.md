# Crystals-Game

Hey there!
I hope you enjoy my game where you get to collect seashells!
Every time the game starts the computer creates a random number that you have to match by picking seashells which also have random numbers generated. If your score more than the number guess - you lose. If you make it equal - you win.
Good luck!
And let me know what you think.
